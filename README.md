# Social-Media-Web-App

## Overview

The Social Media Web App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This project replicates core features of Twitter, including user authentication, posting tweets, following users, and liking posts. It also integrates with Cloudinary for image uploads and uses React Query for efficient data fetching and state management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and log out functionalities with JWT-based authentication.
- **User Profiles**: View and edit user profiles, including profile pictures.
- **Posting Tweets**: Create, edit, and delete tweets with text and image support.
- **Following Users**: Follow and unfollow other users to see their tweets in your feed.
- **Liking Posts**: Like and unlike tweets.
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications for likes and follows.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly design using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- **Real-time Updates**: Real-time updates using React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
